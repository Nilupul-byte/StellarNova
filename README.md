# StellarNova 🌌

> AI-powered natural language trading on MultiversX

Trade crypto with plain English. No complex interfaces. No repeated wallet signatures.

## What is StellarNova?

StellarNova is a **non-custodial DEX interface** that combines instant market swaps with AI-powered limit orders. Users can trade directly via xExchange or set up intelligent limit orders that execute automatically when price conditions are met.

Unlike traditional DEX interfaces, StellarNova offers:
- **Instant Market Swaps** - Direct integration with xExchange router
- **Atlas AI** - AI-analyzed limit orders with automatic execution
- **Natural Language** - Future support for trading via plain English commands

---

## Why StellarNova?

**The Problem:**
- DEX trading requires constant monitoring for price movements
- Setting limit orders is complex and requires technical knowledge
- No AI assistance for trade timing and strategy

**Our Solution:**
- **Market Swaps** - Execute instant swaps through xExchange with one click
- **Limit Orders** - Set price targets and let our backend executor handle execution
- **AI Analysis** - Get AI-powered insights on your trades (powered by DeepSeek)
- **Non-Custodial** - You maintain full control, all transactions signed by your wallet

---

## How It Works

### Basic Mode (Market Swaps)
```
User connects wallet
    ↓
Select tokens & amount
    ↓
Transaction signed by user's wallet
    ↓
Swap executed via xExchange router
    ↓
Tokens received instantly
```

### Atlas AI Mode (Limit Orders)
```
User creates limit order
    ↓
Order stored on-chain with target price
    ↓
Backend executor monitors prices (every 30s)
    ↓
When target price met → auto-execute swap
    ↓
Tokens delivered to user's wallet
```

## Security Model

### Non-Custodial Architecture
- ✅ **User funds never leave user's wallet** (market swaps)
- ✅ **Limit orders use ESDT payment** - Tokens sent with order creation, locked on-chain
- ✅ **User-signed transactions** - All deposits/cancellations require wallet signature
- ✅ **Backend cannot withdraw** - Only executes orders that meet price conditions
- ✅ **Slippage protection** - Max 15-20% slippage to prevent sandwich attacks

### Smart Contract Security
- ✅ Limit order storage with expiration
- ✅ Order ownership validation
- ✅ Price verification before execution
- ✅ Event emissions for all operations
- ⚠️ **Beta Status** - Not yet audited, use at your own risk
